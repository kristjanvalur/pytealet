# tealetio Changelog

All notable changes to the `tealetio` package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Published runnable queue policies (`FifoRunnableQueue`,
	`PrescheduledRunnableQueue`, and `PriorityRunnableQueue`) for explicit
	scheduler construction, including priority-scheduling applications.

### Changed
- Relaxed the `tealet` dependency to the compatible `0.1` range
	(`tealet>=0.1.0rc2,<0.2`) instead of pinning one release candidate exactly.

## [0.1.0rc1] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- First release candidate for `tealetio`, the synchronous asyncio-like runtime built on `tealet`.
- Added scheduler, task, synchronisation, selector, runner, and asyncio coexistence APIs for ordinary tealet code.
- Added package-local tests and documentation for the public API.

### Changed
- Depends on the compatible `tealet` 0.1 release-candidate line for the split workspace release.

### Notes
- Pre-release candidate for validating the package boundary and publication workflow before `0.1.0`.
