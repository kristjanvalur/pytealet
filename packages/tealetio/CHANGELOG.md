# tealetio Changelog

All notable changes to the `tealetio` package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Published runnable queue policies (`FifoRunnableQueue`,
  `PrescheduledRunnableQueue`, and `PriorityRunnableQueue`) for explicit
  scheduler construction, including priority-scheduling applications.
- Added top-level `tealetio.await_()` for awaiting asyncio awaitables from the
  current scheduler task without reaching through the scheduler object.
- Added integration coverage for multi-step async socket send/receive coroutines
  awaited by sibling tealet tasks in both host modes.

### Changed
- Relaxed the `tealet` dependency to the compatible `0.1` range
  (`tealet>=0.1.0rc2,<0.2`) instead of pinning one release candidate exactly.
- Optimised `await_()` coroutine handling so coroutine await protocols are driven
  directly, with yielded asyncio futures waited by the scheduler instead of
  delegating ordinary coroutines to `asyncio.Task` immediately.
- Uses the typed `asynkit.coro_drive` implementation directly for coroutine
  driving.
- Raised the `asynkit` dependency floor to `asynkit>=0.19.2` for the native
  coroutine driver implementation, typed `coro_drive` export, and `syncmethod`
  descriptor.

## [0.1.0rc1] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- First release candidate for `tealetio`, the synchronous asyncio-like runtime built on `tealet`.
- Added scheduler, task, synchronisation, selector, runner, and asyncio coexistence APIs for ordinary tealet code.
- Added package-local tests and documentation for the public API.

### Changed
- Depends on the compatible `tealet` 0.1 release-candidate line for the split workspace release.

### Notes
- Pre-release candidate for validating the package boundary and publication workflow before `0.1.0`.
